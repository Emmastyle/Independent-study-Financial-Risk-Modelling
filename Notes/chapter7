EVT：Around the median, the data is not centrally distributed, but rather spread out. 在中位数附近，数据没有集中分布，而是分散得比较开。

7.2.1 block maxima method
M_n = \max \{ X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n \}
P\{M_n \leq z\} = P\{X_1 \leq z, \cdots, X_n \leq z\} the probability that the maximum value of the n random variables does not exceed z.
Xn i.i.d this joint probability can be split into the product of a single probability: 
P\{X_1 \leq z\} \times P\{X_2 \leq z\} \times \cdots \times P\{X_n \leq z\}   cdf [F(z)]^n
  problem: F(n) often unknown, as n increases, this leads to fairly divergent results.
