6.4 R software package related to GHD
Rmetrics: R language package suite for financial engineering and computational finance, focusing on financial modeling, risk management, asset pricing, time series analysis, and more. It mainly consists of several R packages, including:
• fBasics (Financial Statistics)
• fPortfolio (Portfolio Optimization)
• fAssets (Asset Modeling)
• fOptions (Option Pricing)
• fGarch (GARCH Time Series Modeling)
• timeSeries (Time series data processing)
• fImport (Data Import)
• fExtremes (Modeling Extreme Events)
• fRegression (regression analysis)
Different distribution models: Density function values, probabilities, quantiles and generating random numbers.
                               Density function (starts with d), distribution function (starts with p), quantile function (starts with q) and random number generation (starts with r)
Robust Estimator: An estimator that is insensitive to extreme values. e.g.mean, median, IQR, MAD ( MAD = \text{median}(|X_i - \text{median}(X)|) ), Spearman Rank Correlation.
ghSlider(), hypSlider(), nigSlider().
NIG: Normal Inverse Gaussian Distribution, a special case of the Generalized Hyperbolic (GH) distributions. Heavy-tailed and skewed distributions,self-decomposable,Modeling of financial time series.

f(x | \alpha, \beta, \delta, \mu) = \frac{\alpha \delta K_1(\alpha \sqrt{\delta^2 + (x - \mu)^2})}{\pi \sqrt{\delta^2 + (x - \mu)^2}} e^{\delta \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} + \beta (x - \mu)}
•	\alpha &gt;  0 steepness of the control distribution
• \beta control skewness of distribution
•	\delta &gt;  0 scale of control distribution
• \mu is a location parameter
